# Skin cancer detection assignment using CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## General Information
In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

## Conclusions
- Model is still over fitting as between training accuracy and valuation accuracy gap is still there.
- Accuracy has been improved after solving class imbalance by agumentor.
- Overfitting issue can be solved by adding more layers or drop out layer.
- Hyperparameter tuning can be also used to further improve the model.
